/**
 * What /api/health can honestly say about this deployment.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Health used to answer 200 as soon as PHP was serving, which
 * is a liveness check and nothing more. That let a deploy go green, and a
 * monitor stay quiet, on an app where every real endpoint answered 503 because
 * its database had never been created. "The process is up" and "the app works"
 * are different claims and only one of them is useful.
 *
 * It now also reports whether the database answers and whether the schema has
 * been applied, which is the difference between an app somebody can use and one
 * that only looks alive.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT SAY. This endpoint is UNAUTHENTICATED and public. The driver's
 * own message names the database, the role and the host — PostgreSQL's
 * "no pg_hba.conf entry for host X, user Y, database Z" hands all three to
 * anyone who asks. So the reason is reduced to a category here and the detail
 * goes to the error log, where the person fixing it can read it and a passer-by
 * cannot.
